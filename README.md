### Hello world ðŸ‘‹, My name is Karim Kameli 

### I am a Junior Web Developper.<br/>
I look forward to being able to put into practice the knowledge I acquired during my training at the Wild Code School ðŸ˜ƒ.

### Why a web developer and not an astronaut ?

I was quickly attracted to web development and I'm afraid of the dark and the void so... ðŸ’¨ (naturally) I headed to the web, a mix of **programming** and **design** two elements that interest me **greatly**.

### MIT, Harvard ?
```javascript
const raphael = new Object();
function God() {
  if(raphael.diplomes > 0){
    return console.log("I'm you'r graduate men !");
  }
 return console.log("Sorry, i can do nothing for you.");
}
```

*Sorry, i can do nothing for you.*

**Well, ok... right ðŸ˜•, I didn't come from a major university with 5 years of education so what?**
- [x] My passion and will helped me to become a web developer
- [x] The wild code school trained me well
- [x] Having to solve problems and bugs alone is an obligation
- [x] I know how to search ("google what is a function?")
- [ ] I was able to work in my underpants in remote
``` 
  Error: Too many re-renders. God limits number of
  renders to prevent an infinite loop of stupidity.
  ```
  
  &nbsp;

## So what did you do?

**I developed projects entirely from the development of the model to the deployment (with no backend for the time being) and discovered a multitude of technologies.**<br/>

Plus, as someone who learned by passion with **my time** and **savings** ðŸ’³, I know in advance that for all professional projects 
I am **over motivated** to create someone's project and **help them**.<br/>
~~Every day~~, I strengthen my knowledge to always go further and advance towards my goals.
```js
function GodDetectBullshit(isBullshit) {
  if(isBullshit){
    return console.log("5.5 jours sur 7");
  }
 return console.log(isBullshit);
}
 ```
 
 ### Are you done? Can I leave?

Yes
> No ðŸ˜­

I also have my own **portfolio** where I share my creations and ~~imperfect~~ way of coding.
If you have some time please check it out or contact me if you have a place for me in your team!
